#  Architectural Basics

We will see few basic points that we need to consider while designing a convolutional neural network architecture for an 
image classification problem

The following points are in the order of their importance.

## 1. Receptive Field :

## 2. 3x3 Convolutions :

## 3. MaxPooling :

## When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (

## 4. How many layers:

## 5. Position of MaxPooling :
The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction

## 6. Concept of Transition Layers : 

## 7. Position of Transition Layer :

## 8. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?

## 1x1 Convolutions,

## SoftMax,

## Image Normalization,

## Batch Size, and effects of batch size

## Adam vs SGD

## Learning Rate,

## When to add validation checks

## Number of Epochs and when to increase them,

## How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early

## When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting

## DropOut

## 9. Batch Normalization,

## The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,

## LR schedule and concept behind it
